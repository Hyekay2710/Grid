        <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined,I currently feel i got every penny's worth.</h2>
        <h3>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best "and most gruelling" time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers.  Working as a Software Engineering at a VR start up."</h3>

                        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
                       <h3>"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommended!."</h3>
